# dev.hitchcock.inventory
A showcase of some C# / .NET coding 

<img width="1271" alt="image" src="https://github.com/togabrennan/dev.hitchcock.inventory/assets/46493523/2853e846-d1a4-4ed4-8c31-c329d257bb9d">

Some comments throughout highlighting some concerns / explanations I felt necessary while working through this exercise.

Command pattern implemented with CQRS allows us to optimize data stores / reads as necessary between persisting and reading from internal / external parties (Smark Rack & Teams external to ourselves).

There are a few issues with shipping this (noted in comments, needs way more tests, but highlighted some testing ability) but I think it's enough to showcase the architecture and my coding style.

Talk soon!
